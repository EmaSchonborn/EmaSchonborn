👋🏼 ### Hey there! I'm Emanuel Schönborn — Full Stack Web Developer | Tech Explorer | Language Enthusiast
👤 ## About Me
I'm a curious and driven Full Stack Developer from Argentina with a solid foundation in both Frontend and Backend development. I specialize in building robust, user-focused web applications and thrive at the intersection of design, functionality, and performance.

I combine a strong technical toolkit with a deep passion for communication, languages, and creativity.

💼 ## What I Do
Currently, I work as a freelancer, building and maintaining full-featured web applications for clients. I stay hands-on with the latest technologies while also designing scalable, maintainable architectures.

I'm not just building code — I'm solving problems, refining UX, and collaborating to bring real-world impact through software.

🌍 ## Personal Interests
Besides programming, I'm passionate about languages and communication. I'm actively becoming a polyglot — fluent in English, native in Spanish, and exploring Russian.

I'm also a lifelong musician. In my free time, I love playing the piano 🎹 and guitar 🎸 — creativity flows from code to chords.

🎯 ## My Mission
I'm on a mission to keep evolving — not just as a developer, but as a thinker, collaborator, and human being. I’m especially interested in AI, mental health tech, and meaningful user-focused digital products.

Let’s build tools that matter.
